# LabBot: Dual Robotic Arm System for Chemical Mixing in Hazardous Laboratory Environments

## Project Overview
LabBot is a cutting-edge robotic system designed for **automated chemical mixing and handling** in **dangerous laboratory environments**. It features **two robotic arms** working collaboratively to safely mix chemicals, perform quality checks, and handle hazardous materials. Each arm operates with a high degree of precision and autonomy, minimizing human interaction and exposure to potential hazards.

## Key Features
- **Dual Arm System**: Two robotic arms work together for efficient chemical mixing and handling.
- **7 Degrees of Freedom (DOF) Design**: One arm features 6 revolute joints and a linear rail for extended reach, allowing it to access a wide storage area.
- **Unique DH Parameters**: The robotic arm's motion is optimized for chemical storage and retrieval, ensuring smooth and precise movement.
- **Separation of Tasks**: Each robot arm can perform individual tasks such as measuring, mixing, and sample storage.
- **Safety and Efficiency**: Designed to automate hazardous tasks and reduce human exposure to dangerous chemicals.

## System Components
- **Robot 1**: Responsible for precise measurement and preparation of chemicals.
- **Robot 2**: Manages the mixing, containment, and monitoring of chemical reactions.
- **Linear Rail**: Extends the operational reach of one robotic arm, allowing access to chemicals across a wider storage area.

## Applications
LabBot is ideal for:
- **Chemical Mixing**: Automating the mixing of dangerous or volatile chemicals.
- **Lab Automation**: Performing tasks such as chemical storage, retrieval, equipment cleaning, and quality control.
- **Hazardous Materials Handling**: Safely manipulating toxic, corrosive, or explosive substances in controlled environments.

## Installation & Setup

### Hardware Setup:
1. Mount the robotic arms securely on their respective platforms.
2. Connect the linear rail system to the designated robotic arm.
3. Ensure all power and communication cables are properly connected.

### Software Installation:
1. Clone the LabBot repository.
2. Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed (e.g., robot control libraries, motion planning tools).
3. Configure the DH parameters in the control software to match the specific design of the robotic arms.

### Running the System:
1. Start the robot control software.
2. Use the graphical user interface (GUI) to configure tasks for the robotic arms.
3. Monitor the progress of the chemical mixing process via the GUI.

## Usage Instructions
1. Define the chemical mixing task in the task configuration file.
2. Load the task into the robot control software.
3. Start the operation. The arms will work autonomously to measure, mix, and monitor chemical reactions.
4. Once complete, the system will automatically store or dispose of the resulting chemical mixture based on the task definition.
